# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

I created a code quiz that is timed for 3 minutes. 
Once the start button is clicked, the quiz timmer starts to count down.
Once an answer is selected, a display indicating wheter the answer is correct or incorrect pops up.
When an answer is picked, the person taking the quiz has 4 seconds to change their answer before the next question loads.
Onces the quiz is completed, the score is displayed and the quiz taker is asked whether they would want to restart the quiz.
If they wish to restart the quiz, they click on restart and they take the quiz again.
